Restaurateurs were more willing to take a risk and open more experimental or trendy spots, which led the overall restaurant scene to become less affordable.

By providing a living wage, corporate-owned restaurants could find a talented workforce and remain in the community, and small businesses would have larger customer bases since people have more buying power. Paying living wages has a domino effect in that both chains and small businesses can survive."

It is true, around 10 percent of workers in general and restaurant workers, [some] will get more income from the unemployment checks as opposed to working, but that’s a very small fraction of the industry,” Advincula said. “If you calculate their wages—the unemployment checks are based on the calculated wages—the fact that they have low wages to begin with, [and] when you calculate that over a certain period of time, it’s very tiny.”"

Few restaurant owners would outwardly say that they are not giving substantial living wages to their workers; many assume that employees would work for tips and thus feel little urge to pay higher wages. This power dynamic makes it more difficult for workers to not only fight for better wages but also return to work."

The NYC Department of Small Business Services has launched a number of campaigns to help owners navigate local grants and encourage residents to buy from local businesses. Initiatives like the Restaurant Revitalization Fund and Fair Share NYC have provided technical assistance to many of the city’s restaurants, which a number of local restaurants have accessed. These programs have been particularly helpful for smaller restaurants that received little funding from federal grants or missed out on other aid opportunities."

              "value": "The pandemic has created a great divide between chains and non-chains, but in 2020, every borough experienced notable declines in chain stores. In Manhattan, which was hit the hardest, 17.4 percent of chains closed, accounting for about half of all chain store closures. This is the largest annual decline in chain stores since the Center for an Urban Future began collecting data in 2007. Dig, for example, closed 19 of its locations in 2020, while Starbucks closed 49 and Pret a Manger closed 16. The fact that all these chains still have open locations around Columbia suggests the profitability of operating in Morningside Heights."

Good Guy Guarantees are legal promises stating that tenants unable to pay rent for the remaining lease term must give their landlord about three months notice that they will vacate the place, and in return the tenant has to pay fees up until the departure date."

Around Columbia, many restaurants like Miss Saigon and Bánh have opened on Amsterdam Avenue, and others like Roberta’s are expected to open over the summer."

Also, rents are much more reduced, because there’s so much inventory now, and as the inventory goes up, the price of them goes down, so you’re going to have better and better rent for a while.”"
